This project contains a list of small programs that solve tasks from subject "Basics of logic circuits"

Some step by step guides to those tasks are written in polish and are not yet translated to english.

Programs in order of complexity (from easiest to hardest):






# mealy_automation
works only for manually created list of small sized Mealy automatons

After choosing which result is desired, code can provide additional data needed in solved exercise


# minimize_automation
still lacks features at the end

End steps are currently resolved by a trail and error method which are not yet implemented into code




# Minimize_by_expansion
Finished
Based on two grids F and R
generates a set of smaller grids B(x) based on which we generate "minimum column coverage"
based on those we generate the final grid
from which we once again generate "minimum column coverage" -> final result



# minimum_sets
Finished
Based on an exercise grid we generate a 3 arrays which we combined to generate their specific mix
based this mix we generate "minimum column coverage" -> final result
